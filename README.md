# DataViz
Data visualization with python.
I subscribed to Github on 17 April 2021.
My purpose is to make a code development with Python for data visualization.
For the last week I have been exploring Anaconda to learn coding in Python.
Yesterday I found that Google Colab may provide a good environment for Python code development and 
a good start to share idea among my colleagues. I am still exploring no conclusion yet.
